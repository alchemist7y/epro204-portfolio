# EPRO204 Portfolio — Puja Susling

This is a static, accessible website ready for your EPRO204 Assessment 3 submission. It’s mobile‑friendly, print‑friendly, and easy to host for free.

## Files
- `index.html` — your content (edit this to update wording)
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — small enhancements (mobile nav, “back to top” button)
- This `README.md`

## How to publish for free (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a **free GitHub account** (if you don’t have one).
2. Click **New repository** → name it `epro204-portfolio` (any name is fine).
3. Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` (drag‑and‑drop works).
4. Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Source**: choose **Deploy from a branch**,
   - **Branch**: choose `main` and `/root` (save).
5. Wait ~1 minute. Your live site URL will appear under **Pages** (something like `https://YOURNAME.github.io/epro204-portfolio/`).

> To update later, just upload new files or edit directly on GitHub.

### Custom URL (optional)
- Buy a domain (optional), then in **Settings → Pages** set a **Custom domain** and follow the DNS steps.

## Alternative: Netlify (drag‑and‑drop)
1. Make a free account at **Netlify**.
2. Click **Add new site → Deploy manually** and drag the three files in.
3. Netlify gives you a live URL instantly (you can rename it).

## Alternative: Cloudflare Pages
1. Create a free **Cloudflare** account.
2. Choose **Pages** → **Upload assets** → drag the files.
3. Publish and you’ll get a live URL; you can add a custom domain later.

## Submitting as PDF
- Click **Print / Save as PDF** on the site and save the PDF for Canvas if required.
- The print stylesheet automatically appends URLs after web links.

---

## References (APA 7th)
A starter list is added at the bottom of `index.html`. Replace placeholders (e.g., “add exact page”) with the precise URLs your unit prefers. Keep the list alphabetised.

---

## Editing tips
- Open `index.html` in any editor, make changes, save.
- Keep headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`) and section IDs so the nav links work.
- You can add images by creating an `assets/` folder and referencing them like `assets/photo.jpg` in the HTML.

Good luck with your submission!
